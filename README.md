# Doraemon-Image-created-with-Turtle-graphics-library-
These codes are a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to draw an image of the popular cartoon character "Doraemon." The program uses various Turtle graphics commands to create the outline of Doraemon's face, eyes, mouth, whiskers, and other features.

Here's a breakdown of the main components and functions within the code:

The program begins by importing the necessary functions from the Turtle library.

The code defines several functions, each responsible for drawing a specific part of Doraemon's face, such as the eyes, mouth, whiskers, etc.

The functions use the Turtle graphics commands to create various shapes and patterns on the canvas, effectively building up the image of Doraemon's face piece by piece.

The Doraemon() function is the central function that calls the other functions to draw different parts of Doraemon's face in a coordinated manner.

The program sets up the Turtle graphics environment by configuring the screen size, background color, pen size, and speed of drawing.

The mainloop() function is called to start the Turtle graphics event loop, which displays the final drawing of Doraemon on the screen.

In essence, this code is a creative example of how you can use Python's Turtle graphics library to create intricate drawings and designs. It's important to note that this code is specifically designed to create an image of Doraemon's face and features; it's not a functional game or application, but rather a graphical representation.
